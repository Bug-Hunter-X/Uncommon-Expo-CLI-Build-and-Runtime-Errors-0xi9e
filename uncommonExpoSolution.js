The solution depends on the specific error encountered, but often involves carefully checking the project setup:

1. **Verify `app.json` and `package.json`:** Ensure these files are correctly formatted and contain all necessary information.  Check for typos, missing keys, or invalid values.
2. **Examine project structure:**  Expo CLI has expectations for how project files are organized.  Check for discrepancies between your structure and the Expo documentation.
3. **Dependency conflicts:** Use `expo install` to manage dependencies and resolve any conflicts using tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why`.
4. **Asset management:** Problems with images, fonts, or other assets are common. Verify they are correctly referenced and accessible.
5. **Clean and rebuild:** Sometimes, a simple `expo prebuild --clean` followed by `expo start` can resolve temporary build issues. 
6. **Check for typos in file names and paths:**  Minor typos can lead to unexpected errors.
7. **Expo CLI version:** Make sure you are using a supported and up-to-date version of Expo CLI.  Run `expo -v` to check.
8. **Consult Expo documentation and community forums:** For specific error messages, search Expo's documentation or the community forums for related issues and solutions.
