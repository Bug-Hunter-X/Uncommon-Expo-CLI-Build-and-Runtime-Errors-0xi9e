This error occurs when using Expo CLI with a project that has an unusual or unexpected file structure.  It often manifests as a failure to build, start, or run the project, with error messages that are not immediately clear. The root cause is frequently related to the way Expo CLI interacts with the project's configuration files (like `app.json` or `package.json`), assets, or dependencies. For example, a missing or incorrectly formatted file, a dependency conflict, or an issue with the project's name or ID could lead to this.
